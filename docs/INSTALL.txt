vnccollab.zimbra Installation
-----------------------------

The preferred way to install ``vnccollab.zimbra`` is using buildout.
``vnccollab.zimbra`` depends on a fork of ``pyzimbra`` that hasn't
been merged yet upstream, so it's adviseable to use ``mr.developer``.

A zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``vnccollab.zimbra`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    extensions +=
        mr.developer

    eggs =
        ...
        pyzimbra
        vnccollab.zimbra

    auto-checkout =
      pyzimbra

    [sources]
    # pyzimbra is currently hosted in these places:
    #pyzimbra = git git@github.com:vipod/pyzimbra.git
    pyzimbra = git ssh://www-data@redmine.vnc.biz/pyzimbra branch=develop

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        vnccollab.zimbra

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
